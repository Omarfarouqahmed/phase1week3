## Flatdango theatre
### brief description
The flatdango movie site is a site meant for users to see movies that are screening and are able to purchase tickets through the site.The site shows movies,ticket prices,run times for each movie and screening times.

### steps I followed when making the webpage
1. Fetch the information on the films from the json file .
2.Make a space of sort where the movies and their descriptions will go.
3. Iterate through each movie while making the description, runtime , tickets    and screening time for each movie.
4.Make a button for purchasing a ticket and an event listener to it such that it listens for a click and adds to the number of tickets already sold by one .
5. Make use of patch method to actively update number of tickets sold.

### known issues
I am aware that the button for purchasing a ticket does not lead to a payment page or the tickets sold does not increase by the number of tickets purchased.
